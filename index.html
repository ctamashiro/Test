  <ul>
    <li>What is Cybersecurity?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Cybersecurity is the practice of information/data safety. 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>What are common threats?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    One of the most common threats is phishing. Phishing attacks come in many shapes and forms. However, cybercriminals commonly embed malware and malicious content through email, text, or phone calls to obtain our personal information from unsuspecting victims. It is estimated that 3.4 billion phishing emails get sent daily, accounting for about 94% of cyberattack attempts (Griffiths, 2024). Phishing attempts are social engineering attacks in which criminals make it seemingly innocent, like a free iPhone giveaway, to make individuals click an embedded link and have victims spill out their personal information on cloned websites that may seem like the real one (ncsc.gov, 2018). The cybercriminal could then do anything they want with your information, including identity theft, blackmailing, getting into private accounts, and other immoral activities (ncsc.gov, 2018).

    <li>What is the purpose of this website?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    To address the growing threat of digital attacks, our group will make an online education program that allows users to familiarize themselves with the dangers of the internet. To do this, our group will collaborate and write a program in C++. We will code an algorithm that allows the software to adjust the question based on the user's knowledge. When the client first uses the program, they will be sent for a diagnostic test so the software can measure the client's knowledge. From there, the application will teach the user the topics that they are weak at and periodically throw in questions that they already got right.
